# *Extended* Markdown :writing_hand:

Emanote notes are written in Markdown format. A tutorial is [available here](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/). Below we shall highlight some of the commonmark extensions that Emanote supports on top of standard Mardown syntax.

## Emojis

:smile:

:runner: :ant:

See [list of available emojis](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) for reference.

## Footnotes

https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs/blob/master/commonmark-extensions/test/footnotes.md

Demo: Checkout this note[^1] and this other note[^2] as both are footnotes.

## Task lists

- [x] A task that was done
- [ ] A task that is to be done.
- A list item with no task marker

Tasks can also be written outside of list context, such as paragraphs:

[ ] This is a task on its own paragraph.

[x] Here we have the next paragraph.

## Definition lists

https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs/blob/master/commonmark-extensions/test/definition_lists.md

Fruits
: Apples
: Oranges

Animal Foods
: Eggs
: Diary
: Offal
: Muscle meat

## Hash Tags

Add an #hashtag anywhere in Markdown file. They can also be added to the YAML frontmatter.

## Code Syntax Highlighting

In order to enable syntax highlighting, you must use a client-side JavaScript highlighter, such as [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/), and add it to `page.headHtml` of [[yaml-config]] (if adding to all or multiple routes) or Markdown frontmatter (if adding to a single route):

```yaml
page:
  headHtml: |
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs@1.23.0/themes/prism-tomorrow.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/npm/prismjs@1.23.0/prism.min.js,npm/prismjs@1.23.0/plugins/autoloader/prism-autoloader.min.js"></script>
```

Example using PrismJS:

```python
def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()
fib(1000)
```

[^1]: Reference to a note.
[^2]: Another reference to a note.
